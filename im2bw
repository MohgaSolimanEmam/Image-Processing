%here we basically need the binary image without using the im2bw function
%so we need to take the orginal image and get the gray scale then we can
%get the binary vision by using a threshold

function rgb2binary()

%reading a rgb random image and storing it in a variable 
pic = imread('peppers.png');
%subplotting the original image to show it next to the gray scale image
subplot(1,4,1), imshow(pic), title('rgb image');
%doubling the image to fit with the output image
pic = im2double(pic);
%storing the sum of the red vision (::1) of the image and the green
%vision (::2) and the blue vision (::3) of the image to get the gray scale
outpic = .4*pic(:,:,1) + .50*pic(:,:,2) + .30*pic(:,:,3);
%subplotting the gray scale image to show it next to the original image
subplot(1,4,2), imshow(outpic), title('gray scale image');
%the binary image without using the im2bw
binaryPic = outpic > 0.4;
%subplotting the binary image to show it next to the gray scale image and
%the original image
subplot(1,4,3), imshow(binaryPic), title('binary image');
