%here we want to implement the log transformation
function logTransformation()
%reading the rgb image
orginal = imread('peppers.png');
% %subplotting the original image to show it next to the log image
subplot(1,2,1),imshow(orginal),title('orginal rgb image');
%doubling the image
orginal = im2double(orginal);
%taking a value as my factor in the log (C) transformation
factor = 2;
%taking the size measurements of the image to loop over it
[x,y,~] = size(orginal);
%looping over the rows and columns to get the log of the image
for i = 1:1:x
    for j = 1:1:y
        outpic(i,j) = factor * log(1+orginal(i,j));
    end
end
% %subploting the log image with the orginal image
subplot(1,2,2),imshow(outpic),title('log rgb image');
