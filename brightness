function rgb2binary()

%reading a rgb random image and storing it in a variable 
pic = imread('peppers.png');
%subplotting the original image to show it next to the gray scale image
subplot(3,3,1), imshow(pic), title('rgb image');

%decreasing the brightness of the rgb image

%doubling the image to fit with the output image

%storing the sum of the red vision (::1) of the image and the green
%vision (::2) and the blue vision (::3) of the image to get the gray scale

%decreasing the brightness of the gray scale image
subplot(3,3,6), imshow(outpic/3), title('low bright gray scale');

%the binary image without using the im2bw

%subplotting the binary image to show it next to the gray scale image and
%the original image
